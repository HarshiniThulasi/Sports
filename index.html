            <p><b>Basic gameplay: bowler to batter</b><br>
                
            During normal play, thirteen players and two umpires are on the field. Two of the players are batters and the rest are all eleven members of the fielding team. The other nine players in the batting team are off the field in the pavilion.

        <h3 id="football">Football</h3>
        <p>Modern football originated in Britain in the 19th century. Since before medieval times, "folk football" games had been played in towns and villages according to local customs and with a minimum of rules. Industrialization and urbanization, which reduced the amount of leisure time and space available to the working class, combined with a history of legal prohibitions against particularly violent and destructive forms of folk football to undermine the game’s status from the early 19th century onward.</p><p> However, football was taken up as a winter game between residence houses at public (independent) schools such as Winchester, Charterhouse, and Eton. Each school had its own rules; some allowed limited handling of the ball and others did not. The variance in rules made it difficult for public schoolboys entering university to continue playing except with former schoolmates. As early as 1843 an attempt to standardize and codify the rules of play was made at the University of Cambridge, whose students joined most public schools in 1848 in adopting these “Cambridge rules,” which were further spread by Cambridge graduates who formed football clubs. In 1863 a series of meetings involving clubs from metropolitan London and surrounding counties produced the printed rules of football, which prohibited the carrying of the ball. Thus, the “handling” game of rugby remained outside the newly formed Football Association (FA). Indeed, by 1870 all handling of the ball except by the goalkeeper was prohibited by the FA.</p>

        <h3 id="badminton">Badminton</h3>
        <p>Badminton is a racket sport played by either two opposing players (singles) or two opposing pairs (doubles), who take positions on opposite halves of a rectangular court that is divided by a net. Players score points by striking a shuttlecock with their racket so that it passes over the net and lands in their opponents' half of the court. A rally ends once the shuttlecock has struck the ground, and the shuttlecock may only be struck once by each side before it passes over the net.</p>
        <p>The shuttlecock (or shuttle) is a feathered projectile whose unique aerodynamic properties cause it to fly differently from the balls used in most racket sports; in particular, the feathers create much higher drag, causing the shuttlecock to decelerate more rapidly than a ball. Shuttlecocks have a much higher top speed, when compared to other racket sports. As the shuttlecock flight is stubbornly affected by wind, competitive badminton is always played indoors. Badminton is also played outdoors as a casual recreational activity, often as a garden or beach game.</p>

        <h3 id="chess">Chess</h3>
        <p>The origins of chess are not exactly clear, though most believe it evolved from earlier chess-like games played in India almost two thousand years ago. The game of chess we know today has been around since the 15th century where it became popular in Europe.</p>
        <p>Chess is a game played between two opponents on opposite sides of a board containing 64 squares of alternating colors. Each player has 16 pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 2 knights, and 8 pawns. The goal of the game is to checkmate the other king. Checkmate happens when the king is in a position to be captured (in check) and cannot escape from capture.”</p>
        <p>Many kids play video games that are addictive in a negative way. Some of the downsides to video game playing are: the intense need for instant gratification, playing non-stop for hours taking away time for connecting with others, addiction withdrawal symptoms when asked to cut down or stop their playing-mood swings and agitation increase.</p>

        <h3 id="basketball">Basketball</h3>
        <p>Basketball is a team sport played between two teams of five players each on a rectangular court, generally indoors. The objective of the sport is to toss the ball through the opponent’s basket (or goal), which is an elevated horizontal ring with a net. Basketball may be called as the sole major sport of US origin (there is a reasonable skepticism over Baseball’s American origin). It was in 1891 that James Naismith invented the game in Massachusetts.  Although mostly played in North America, the game is now gaining wide popularity in Asian countries, especially in China. Basketball is an Olympic game as well, having been officially inducted in 1936.</p>

        <h3 id="hockey">Hockey</h3>
        <p>Hockey, as a sport of stick and ball, dates back to middle-age. Some of the carvings of this sport were found in Ireland and Greece in 1200 and 600 BC respectively. It is assumed that the sport existed some 4000 years ago. However, hockey took its actual form with government organization to recognize the sport. Hence, specific rules of the game were introduced in early 19th century. Countries like England, Germany, Argentina, Spain, India, Malaysia, and Pakistan have international teams and take part in all the annual events organized by International Hockey Federation (FIH) formed in 1924.</p>
         <p>As Hockey was literally originated in England, Scotland and Netherlands, it was encouraged by various other countries as they participated in the game. The International Hockey Federation governs the sport all over the globe. Men and women represent in competitions including Olympics Games, Champions Trophy, World League and Junior World Cup with many countries which run masters’, senior and junior club competitions. This body is responsible for rules development for the game.</p>

            The javelin that is used in modern international men's competition is a spear of wood or metal with a sharp metal point. It is constructed in accordance with a detailed set of specifications published by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). Its overall length must be at least 260 cm (102.4 inches) and its weight at least 800 grams (1.8 pounds). The women’s javelin is somewhat shorter and lighter—a minimum 220 cm (86.6 inches) long and 600 grams (1.3 pounds) in weight.</p>

        <h3 id="golf">Golf</h3>
        <p>golf, a cross-country game in which a player strikes a small ball with various clubs from a series of starting points (teeing grounds) into a series of holes on a course. The player who holes his ball in the fewest strokes wins. The origins of the game are difficult to ascertain, although evidence now suggests that early forms of golf were played in the Netherlands first and then in Scotland.</p>
        <p>From a somewhat obscure antiquity, the game attained worldwide popularity, especially in the 20th century. Nothing is known about the early game’s favourite venues on the European continent, but in Scotland golf was first played on seaside links with their crisp turf and natural hazards. Only later in the game’s evolution did play on downs, moorland, and parkland courses begin. Golfers participate at every level, from a recreational game to popular televised professional tournaments. Despite its attractions, golf is not a game for everyone; it requires a high degree of skill that is honed only with great patience and dedication.</p>

        <p>Boxing is a captivating and intense combat sport that demands exceptional physical abilities, mental fortitude, and strategic prowess from its participants. The game involves two highly skilled fighters, known as boxers, who go head-to-head in a battle of reflexes, endurance, speed, and strength.
